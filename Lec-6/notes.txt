One Hot Encoding

1. Using pandas get_dummies
2. Using Sklearn OneHotEncoder


Q build a predictor function to predict price of a home.

1. with 3400 sqr ft area in west windsor
2. 2800 sqr ft home in robbinsville


handle text column

cant use number for handling the text because it takes mathematically sense over there.


categorial Variables
1. normal = no relation over the Variables
2. ordinal= relation over the Variables

to encode the text data there is important technique that is ONE HOT ENCODING

One hot encoding== creating a new columns and assigns 0 and 1 over there



Excercise 

all the same level as this notebook on github, there is an Excercise folder that contains.csv. this file has car sell prices for 3 different models. First plot data points on a scatter plot chart to see if linear regression model can be applied. if yes then build a model that can answer following questions.

1). Predict price of a mercedez benz that is 4 yr old with milearge 45000.
2). Predict price of a BMW that is 7 yr old with mileage 86000.
3). Tell me the score(accuracy) of your model. Hint use Linear Regression().score()
