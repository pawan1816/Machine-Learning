you just have to know overview of the math not in details for machine learning



y=2x+ 3

x=[1,2,3,4,5]

y=[5,7,9,11,13]

you have input output and you have to predication function
equation(predication function)--> Mean square error (cost function)


Gradient descent is an algorithm that finds best fit line for given training dataset


disadvantages 
it misses the global minima in the fixed step of reducation of MSE(cost)

solution 
reduce the MSE(cost) with very small small value. use derivatives.

slope= change in Y / change in X

if the slope x approch 0, its accuracy will increase.



to stop the iteration use iscloase()
