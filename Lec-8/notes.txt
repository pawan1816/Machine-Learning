Linear Regression
ex- Home prices, Weather, Stock prices

Predicted value is continuous


Classification
ex- Email is spam or not 
will customer buy life insurance?
which party a person is going to vote for 1. BJP 2. Congress 3. AAP

Predicted value is categorical



Logistic regression is one of the techniques used for Classification.


Classification Types 
1. Binary Classification.
2. Multiclass Classification.


Logistic regressoin uses Sigmoid or Logistic function


Sigmoid (Z) = 1/1+pow(e,-z)
e= Euler's number ~ 2.71828

Sigmoid function Convert input into range 0 to 1

general linear regression function===> y = m * x + b 
Sigmoid linear regression function==> y = 1/(1+ pow(e,-(m*x +b)))
